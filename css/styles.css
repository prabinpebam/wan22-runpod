/* CSS Architecture & Theming Plan
   1. Settings/Tokens: keep all design variables centralized in :root.
   2. Tools/Utilities: future mixins/helpers live below the token block.
   3. Objects & Components: continue grouping by layout (app/frame) then components (forms, queue, modals, crop).
   4. States: modifiers (e.g., .processing, .failed) stay near their components.
   5. Theming: prefer [data-theme] hooks so toggling only updates tokens; components keep referencing variables. */
